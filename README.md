# School_District_Analysis
Module 4 - Pandas in Jupyter

## Overview of School District Analysis
The school district has completed student testing, but has discovered that Thomas High School ninth grade scores are suspect. The school district would like the scores of Thomas High School ninth grade students nulled out and then calculations ran on that data.

Provided with schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv the following list of deliverables is required:

* A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
* An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
* Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  * Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  * The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  * The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  * School performance based on the budget per student
  * School performance based on the school size 
  * School performance based on the type of school

## Results of Analysis
